        And I can see the save button is visible, but disabled
        And I can see the cancel button
        And I cannot see the edit icon as it is not visible in edit mode

    Scenario Outline: AC2 The save button is only enabled if the piece of evidence has been modified in some way.
        Given I am on edit mode for an evidence I own
        And I can see this evidence has the <field> filled in
        And I can see the save button is visible, but disabled

    Scenario: AC3 When I click on a skill tag, I can edit it.
    This is useful if I find that I made a spelling mistake.
    when this piece of evidence is saved, the tag will be changed globally for me.
    (i.e., the spelling will be corrected on all my pieces of evidence and in associated headings).
        Given I am on edit mode for an evidence I own
        And I can see this evidence has an "original_skill" skill tag
